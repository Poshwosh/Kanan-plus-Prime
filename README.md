### Poshwosh's Prime

##### Main adjustments:
- [Ranged skills have been recolored to green](http://i.imgur.com/y8Usjai.png), and have been placed into Hybrid which is now called Archery. 
- [Hybrid skills have been recolored](http://i.imgur.com/Hh6pkGE.png) and re-categorized to their own skill tabs. Study: Potion Lore is now in Life, Doppleganger and Berserk are in Combat, Shockwave is now in Magic, Counter Punch is in Fighter, and Spider Shot is in Archery.
- All skill icons received a [minor shade tune-up](http://i.imgur.com/pOpLZs3.png) to fit film style post shader better.
- [Cloth, Metal, Wand, Pet, Instrument and Spirit Weapon dye icons  have been remade](http://i.imgur.com/lxtx8m5.png) for easier color identification.
- Dye Ampoule (regular 5 spot RNG one) now uses the Mini Dye Ampoule icon for easier identification.
- [Replaced old hairs with updated versions](http://i.imgur.com/k4KmMah.png) included in the Tir Chornail update in 2013.
- Rock Throwing can now target enemies with Ctrl + Click.
- Images and tips on loading screen have been removed to increase loading time.
- Removed gathering failure messages due to cringe, simplified out of resource and equipment breakage messages.
- Shadow Wizard spam map recreated to work with recent map update.
- Fixed "FINISH!" not appearing properly above enemy names.
- Arc Lich is now much, much more noticeable and easier to sketch.
- Ancients are now [much more noticeable to spot](http://i.imgur.com/bML6Wfg.png).
- Renamed the following skills: Transformation Mastery > Shapeshift, Shyllien Ecology > Ecology, Hillwen Engineering > Engineering, Rare Mineralogy > Mineralogy, Ranged Attack > Ranged Mastery.

##### Looting adjustments:
- [Increased the clickable size when you hold down ALT for easier looting](http://i.imgur.com/T3HBqO9.png) of the following: Gold, Treasure Keys, Fine and Finest Leather, Herbs and 100's and 300's Potions.
- Made the following items unlootable from the ground when you hold down ALT: 10's, 30's, 50's Potions, Cheap and Common Leather and Fabric, Branches, Gems, Sulfur Ore, Phoenix Feather, Bandage, Alchemy Crystals (exception: Arat), Arrow, Bolt, Magic Powder.
The purpose of these changes is to clean the screen when you hold down ALT, now the only things that show up are important loot, all the junk is filtered away.

##### Talent Title remake:
- Fledging Archer is now Rank F Archer, Novice Archer is now Rank E Archer ... Master Archer is now Rank 1 Archer, Grandmaster Archer is now Master Archer.
This was done for easier progress identification and to also fit in the old skill system. When somebody turns silver, they'll be rank 9, when they're gold, they'll be rank 5, etc.
- Mage has been renamed Wizard.
- Knight renamed to Lancer.
- Warrior renamed to Knight.
- Fighter renamed to Martial Artist. 

##### Sound tweaks:
- Decreased the volume of opening inventory to accommodate large amount of bags.
- Muted blacksmith hammer (Edern)
- Muted pickaxe (Poulnabrone miners)
- Muted golem 'woo' (players tend spam this)
- Muted Bullet Storm's gun spinning (ditto)
- Sheeps swallowed a balloon...?!
- Muted Mini dragon walking stomps
- Muted bird wing flaps
- Muted opening window sound (To mute the noise when summoning pets)

##### Text differences:
Most of these are simple text tweaks to improve upon translation and remove nuisance. It removes annoying text ("You've entered the world of Mabinogi", "Critical Hit!!!", default enchant info, your combo card will expire in 5 days, etc).
It also [fixes font clipping when using bitmap font](http://i.imgur.com/tTrX3Q3.png), and [simplifies the daily effects](http://i.imgur.com/aCwA0aG.png).
